JScraper
Programming: Matthew Brandt (Bowling Green State University) & Kevin Wang (Ohio State University)


OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------
JScraper is a program that opens a user input webpage
and parses the source file for email addresses. 
This program writes found addresses to the file 
OUTPUT.txt and if the file does not exist within the 
immediate directory, the program creates it.

PROGRAM USE
--------------------------------------------------
Double click the .jar file and the program will prompt 
the user to enter a URL. Submit the URL and the 
program will write all found email addresses in the 
output file. Note that this program only reads the 
website's source file, not javascript elements.
